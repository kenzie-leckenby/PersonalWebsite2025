## My New Personal Website for 2025!

My old one definitely needed refreshing as I havn't touched it in 2 years and I have learned a lot since then so it is certainly dated. This time I have built the site using react for its added modularity instead of stock html, css, and javaScript. I am also using Material Ui for their added components so I don't have to style everything from the ground up.
